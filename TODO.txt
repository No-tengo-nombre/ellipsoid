=== TODO List ===
  + Implement batch rendering.
  + Turn the headers in OpenGL into API-agnostic headers. This would
    make it so that there is only one set of header files, and you
    import the library corresponding to the API you want to use.
      + Abstract away the classes that come with OpenGL.
  + Add Vulkan support.
  + Fix the bugs in the shaders.
  + Figure out why the program is not working.
  + Fix the aforementioned issue.
  + Make the whole program more configurable (right now it assumes a lot of
    configurations, and doesn't allow the user to easily change them without
    interacting with the rendering API).
